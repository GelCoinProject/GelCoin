### MacDeploy ###

For Snow Leopard (which uses [Python 2.6](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6/)), you will need the param_parser package:

	sudo easy_install argparse

This script should not be run manually, instead, after building as usual:

	make deploy

During the process, the disk image window will pop up briefly where the fancy
settings are applied. This is normal, please do not interfere.
