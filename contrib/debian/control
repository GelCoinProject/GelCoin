Package: gelcoind
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 GelCoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. GelCoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. GelCoin
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, gelcoind, and the CLI tool
 gelcoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

Package: gelcoin-qt
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

 This package provides GelCoin-Qt, a GUI for GelCoin based on Qt.

Package: gelcoin-tx
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 GelCoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. GelCoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. GelCoin
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides gelcoin-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a gelcoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.

Package: luxd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Lux is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, luxd, and the CLI tool
 lux-cli to interact with the daemon.
